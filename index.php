		The Rectangular Cube Volume Calculator allows users to easily determine the volume of a rectangular cube by inputting its width, height, and depth. The formula used for calculating the volume is straightforward: volume = width * height * depth. Users simply input the dimensions of the rectangular cube, and the application instantly computes and displays the volume.

In the Home Solar Heating Calculator section, users can assess the solar heating potential of their homes by providing relevant information through a form. This form includes five fields: home style, home size (in square feet), sunlight index, home facing cardinal direction, and solar heating type. The sunlight index refers to the intensity of sunlight hitting the home, while the home facing cardinal direction indicates the direction the home is oriented towards. Users can choose the solar heating type based on their preferences and needs.
